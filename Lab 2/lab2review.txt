Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the incorrect format. When I run the program
  it gives the output in the incorrect format. I think you misunderstood the
  handout. If I do this:
--
$ java driverDFA gncgwng
Congrats, thats corrrect
--
it tells me that it is the correct answer; however, it is not in the correct
format. Your program should work as follows:
--
$ java driverDFA gncgwng
That is a solution.

See the difference?


Style:

- Correct indentation

- Opening braces are misplaced. Opening braces must appear on the same line as
  the preceding statement (i.e. function opening, if, for, while, case, etc.).

- Good block comments

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}

- Code (or comments) go beyond 100 characters. Keep lines of code short.
  Optimally 80 characters, but no more than 100.


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.
